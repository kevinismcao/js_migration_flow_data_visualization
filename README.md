# WHERE PEOPLE ARE MOVING TO?

## Background
3 years after Covid-19 pandemic start, there were many speculation about emptied downtowns and the prospect of remote work. This interactive site aims to visulize the migration pattern in 2020, when the virus started to spread. Click on a specific state will show different county within state and their moving patterns.(To other counties within the state or other states.) Project current phase might focus on state California only. As the project keep moving forward I could add selections for other states as well. 

## Functionality & MVPs
In the WHERE PEOPLE ARE MOVING TO?, users will be able to:
* Track each county's resident move in and move out numbers and where they are actually moving to? (either other counties in the same state or other states)
* Interact with the county or state user are interested in and lead to datas they search or click for.
* Hover over other state or counties will highlight string/color ribbon that it assocciated with.
* Hover over other state or counties will show datas that it assocciated with.
* Selection tab to select the states and counties user are looking for.

In addition, this project will include:
* A production README
